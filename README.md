**8-2 Journal: Portfolio Submission**

**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

The client, The Gaming Room, is a company that specializes in creating and hosting various game experiences. They approached me as a technology consultant to design software for their game called "Draw It or Lose It." They wanted me to develop a plan on how to expand the game so it could be run on multiple operating systems so they can expand their customer base. I helped design a cross-platform compatible web application.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

In developing the documentation, I focused on providing a comprehensive overview of the software design, including recommendations for various aspects such as operating systems, architectures, storage management, memory management, distributed systems networks, and security. I made the recommendations in line with the customer's requirements and budget in mind. Additionally, I provided detailed explanations and justifications for the chosen design decisions.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

At the moment, the code has not been developed yet. My focus was on creating a design document. However, once the design document is utilized, the process of coding would become much more efficient as the initial plan has already been established.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

If I were to make improvements to my work on these documents, I would concentrate on enhancing the security section. Security is frequently overlooked, but it should be given priority. Although the document provided suggestions, it could benefit from a more thorough examination of potential security threats and corresponding countermeasures. The inclusion of detailed risk assessments, secure coding practices, and encryption protocols would significantly bolster the security aspects of the software design.

**How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?**

To address user needs, I focused on compatibility across operating systems by designing a browser-based game accessible on any device. This approach provided a consistent experience for users regardless of their OS. Minimizing costs was also a priority, so I suggested using Linux servers for the backend infrastructure. Linux servers offer reliability, security, and cost-effectiveness. By adopting Linux servers, operational expenses could be reduced while maintaining game performance and stability.

The definition of user can be interpreted in two ways: client and end user. It's important to consider the needs of the client because we need to build the right software to help the client achieve their business goals. On the other hand, it's also important to consider the needs of the end user by providing a user-friendly and fast experience so they can access and enjoy using the software. Increasing the number of end users can boost our client's profits and lead to continued business with our client.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

I followed a systematic approach to software design, beginning with requirements gathering to understand the client's vision. Extensive research on best practices and modern technologies informed my design decisions. For future projects, I would employ techniques like prototyping to gather user feedback early on and refine the design iteratively. Collaboration and communication within the development team would be a priority, involving designers, developers, and stakeholders to leverage their expertise.
